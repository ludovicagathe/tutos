Overview
Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.

Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).

Markdown	HTML
# Heading level 1	<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
## Heading level 2	<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
### Heading level 3	<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
#### Heading level 4	<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
##### Heading level 5	<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
###### Heading level 6	<h6>Heading level 6</h6>

Emphasis
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

Markdown	HTML
I just love **bold text**.	I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.
I just love __bold text__.	I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.
Love**is**bold	Love<strong>is</strong>bold

Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

Markdown	HTML
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.	Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.	Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.
A*cat*meow	A<em>cat</em>meow
Bold and Italic
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

Markdown	HTML	Rendered Output
This text is ***really important***.	This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is ___really important___.	This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is __*really important*__.	This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This text is **_really important_**.	This text is <strong><em>really important</em></strong>.
This is really***very***important text.	This is really<strong><em>very</em></strong>important text.

Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

Nested Blockquotes
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.


Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

URLs and Email Addresses
To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.
<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>


Code
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
Markdown
At the command prompt, type `nano`.	At the command prompt, type <code>nano</code>.

If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``).
Markdown
``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``	<code>Use `code` in your Markdown file.</code>

Code Blocks
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>


Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

***

Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).


Adding Titles
You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
